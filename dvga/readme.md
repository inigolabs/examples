## DVGA Demo
Example is based on [Damn-Vulnerable-GraphQL-Application](https://github.com/dolevf/Damn-Vulnerable-GraphQL-Application)

The purpose of this demo is to show how Inigo secures your GraphQL application in an effortless manner.

### Play around
1. Use Postman to send API requests to ```/graphql``` route.
2. Use ```/graphiql``` (notice lowercase 'i') route to run requests directly on the application.
